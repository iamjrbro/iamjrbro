### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, welcome to my profile!

I am a Analysis and Systems Development,Â´s student, who is passionate about technology, and constantly seeking knowledge. My goal is to build a solid career in the programming field and contribute to the development of innovative solutions.

Currently, I am focused on enhancing my skills in two essential programming languages: Python and C. I have been dedicated to exploring the features and syntax of these languages.

Always focused on improving my skills, I am a proactive person who constantly seeks challenges to expand my technical abilities and learn from new experiences. I am motivated by solving complex problems and I am always willing to take on challenges that allow me to grow professionally and personally.

I am open to internship opportunities and collaboration on projects related to analysis and systems development. I am interested in gaining practical experience, working in a team, and contributing my knowledge in Python and C to create efficient and scalable solutions.

If you are interested in connecting and discussing collaboration opportunities, I am available to exchange ideas and share knowledge.
