### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm 19 years old and started studying everything related to technology about 1 year ago. During this period, I evolved into Python and learned to work with analysis and development and Cloud Artificial Intelligence, especially in Microsoft and Google-related services. 
As someone who is always focused on improving my skills, I became a System Analysis and Development student and am in the first period of college.
