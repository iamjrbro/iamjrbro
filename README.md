### Hi there, IÂ´m Julia ðŸ‘‹

I'm 19 years old and IÂ´ve started studying everything related to technology about 1 year ago. During this period, IÂ´ve learn to work with analysis and development and Cloud Artificial Intelligence, especially in Microsoft and Google-related services. 
As someone who is always focused on improving my skills, I became a System Analysis and Development's student and am in the first period of college.
I am currently learning Python and C.
