I'm currently learning Python and C language.
For approximately a year, Ive been seeking to enhance my knowledge in the technology field. Therefore, IÂ´ve  taken some courses, enrolled in a bachelor's program in Analysis and Systems Development, and continue to strive for improvement in this area.
As someone who is always focused on enhancing my skills, I am curious, adaptable, flexible and easygoing. I am always willing to learn and take on new challenges.
